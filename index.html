<h1>Candles throughout history </h1>
Candle making was developed independently <strong>in many places throughout history</strong>.
Candle moulding machine in Indonesia circa <time>1920.</time>
Candles were made by the <i>Romans</i> beginning about <time year="500 before Christ">500 BC.</time> These were true dipped candles and made from tallow. Evidence for candles 
made from whale fat in <i>China</i> dates back to the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). In India, wax from boiling cinnamon was used for temple 
candles. In parts of <i>Europe</i>, the <i>Middle-East</i> and <i>Africa</i>, where lamp oil made from olives was readily available, candle making remained
unknown until the early middle-ages. Candles were primarily made from tallow and beeswax in ancient times, but have been made from 
spermaceti, purified animal fats (stearin) and paraffin wax in recent centuries.

<h3><p>Antiquity</p></h3>
The early <i>Greeks</i> used candles to honour the goddess Artemis's birth on the sixth day of every lunar month. Romans began making true 
dipped candles from allow, beginning around <abbr aria-label="before Christ">500 BC.</abbr> While oil lamps were the most widely used source of illumination in Roman Italy, 
candles were common and regularly given as gifts during Saturnalia. The mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang <abbr aria-label="before Christ">259–210 BC</abbr>, contained candles 
made from whale fat. The word zhú was used as candle during the Warring States period <abbr aria-label="before Christ">403–221 BC</abbr>; some excavated bronzewares from 
that era feature a pricket thought to hold a candle. The Han Dynasty 202 <abbr aria-label="Before Christ">BC</abbr> to 220<abbr aria-label="Anno Domini">AD</abbr> Jizhupian dictionary of about 40 BC hints at 
candles being made of beeswax, while the Book of Jin compiled in 648 covering the Jin Dynasty <time year="265–420">265-420</time> makes a solid reference to
the beeswax candle in regards to its use by the statesman Zhou Yi. An excavated earthenware bowl from the 4th century AD, 
located at the Luoyang Museum, has a hollowed socket where traces of wax were found. Generally these Chinese candles were molded in 
paper tubes, using rolled rice paper for the wick, and wax from an indigenous insect that was combined with seeds.Wax from boiling 
cinnamon was used for temple candles in <i>India</i>. Yak butterwas used for candles in Tibet There is a fish called the eulachon or 
"candlefish", a type of smelt which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the 1st century AD, indigenous people from this region 
used oil from this fish for illumination. A simple candle could be made by putting the dried fishon a forked stick and then lighting it.

<h3><p>Middle Ages</p></h3> 
After the collapse of the Roman empire, trading disruptions made olive oil, the most common fuel for oil lamps, unavailable 
throughout much of Europe. As a consequence, candles became more widely used. By contrast, in North Africa and the Middle East, 
candle-making remained relatively unknown due to the availability of olive oil.
Candles were commonplace throughout Europe in the Middle Ages. Candle makers (known as chandlers) made candles from fats saved 
from the kitchen or sold their own candles from within their shops. The trade of the chandler is also recorded by the more 
picturesque name of "smeremongere", since they oversaw the manufacture of sauces, vinegar, soap and cheese. The popularity of 
candles is shown by their use in Candlemas and in Saint Lucy festivities.
<p>Tallow, fat from cows or sheep, became the standard material used in candles in Europe. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is 
due to the glycerine they contain. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in 
several European cities. Beeswax was discovered to be an excellent substance for candle production without the unpleasant odour, 
but remained restricted in usage for the rich and for churches and royal events, due to their great expense.
In England and France, candle making had become a guild craft by the 13th century. The Tallow Chandlers Company of London was 
formed in about 1300 in London, and in 1456 was granted a coat of arms. The Wax Chandlers Company existed prior to 1330 and 
acquired its charter in 1484. By 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The first candle mould comes from the 15th 
century in Paris.</p>

<h3><p>The Modern Era</p></h3>
By the 19th century, candles were made on an industrial scale. This was to meet the demands of a growing population and better 
living conditions for the masses. The industrial-scale manufacture of candles was made possible thanks to the work of <b class="person">Joseph Morgan</b>.
A Manchester-based pewterer who patented a machine which allowed for the continuous production of moulded candles. Morgan’s machine
could produce up to 1,500 candles per hour. This also saw the introduction of braided, rather than twisted, wicks. Which helped to produce better performing,
self-trimming candles.

<p><h1>Curiosity about candles today</h1></p>
<article>
Study done by Wiking found that 28% of Danes say they light candles every day, 23% 4-6 days a week, 23% 1-3 days a week, 8% less than 1-3 days per month while only 4% say they never light candles. 14% said they don’t know and I’m hoping that means they don’t know how many days and not that they don’t know if they light candles.

And the candle business is booming in Denmark. According to the European Candle Association, Denmark burns more candles per person than any other country in Europe. Each Dane burns around six kilos of candle wax each year which is 13.2277 pounds (which takes me back to high school math).

When it is dark and cold outside, there’s nothing more hyggeligt than peppering your home with candles. But it’s not just a winter/darkness custom, Danes use candles in spring and summer.

<p><b class"person">Rufus Gifford</b>, former United States Ambassador to Denmark, spoke about the abundance of candles:</p>

<p>“…it is not just in the living room. It is everywhere. In your classrooms, in your boardrooms. As an American, you think “Fire hazard! – how can you possibly have an open flame in your classroom?”

<p> good example of how important the candle is in Denmark, in Danish lyseslukker is the word for what English languages would call a spoilsport, cold fish, killjoy, party pooper, stick in the mud, wet blanket (someone who puts an end to others’ fun). Lyseslukker literally means “the one who puts out the candles.” I can’t wait to use this term some time. I wonder if Rose Nyland ever used in on The Golden Girls?</p>

<p><strong>Special candle occasion in Denmark.</strong></p>

On May 4th you are likely to see more than the usual number of candles in the windows of homes in Denmark. It is a reminder that on the evening of May 4, 1945 the BBC announced that German forces who had occupied Denmark had surrendered. As with all countries there were many blackouts at night so enemy planes could not find the cities or targets. When the announcement was made the Danish citizens put a candle in their window to welcome back the light.

The official celebration of Denmark’s liberation is May 5th. However, the official papers – when the German army surrendered in all of Northern Europe, and Denmark was declared free, were signed on May 4, 1945. The signing took place in a forest outside Luneburg in Germany on Timeloberg Hill.</section>

<h1>What people buy: candles and accedssories</h1>
Sixty-two percent of U.S. households purchased candles in 2003, down slightly from the 65 percent who purchased in 2001. That makes candles the second most widely purchased home product category, after stationery and greeting cards. With nearly two-thirds of American households buying candles in 2003, there is little new growth available in the market-place. The simple fact is the candle market has reached a plateau and further growth will be hard for marketers and retailers to come by easily.

<section>
<p><strong>Industry Snapshot</p></strong>
Since 2000, retail sales of candles have dropped 12.2 percent, while sales of candle accessory items, such as displays, candlesticks, decorative jar lids, and lighting and extinguishing accessories, have grown 44 percent (see Figure 8.6). Overall the sales of candles and candle accessories were about even in 2002 with sales in 2000.

<p><strong>Retail Overview</strong></p>
Some of the decline in retail sales of candles since 2000 has been due to the rapid expansion of candles beyond the specialty retailer channels, where higher prices are common, into the discount and mass merchant channels, which reward value pricing. Whereas seven years ago or so the premium brands of candles were almost exclusively distributed in specialty-retail and gift boutiques, today mass merchants, grocery, drug, and other mass-market outlets have reached a 40 percent share of market and become the single largest distribution channel for candles.

<p>In terms of specialty retail, the brand leaders are Yankee Candle, Intimate Brand's White Barn Candle, and Blyth's Partylite and Colonial Candle of Cape Cod brands. Yankee Candle operates 250 specialty stores in mall locations and distributes its line through 14,000 specialty gift retailers. They also are distributed nationally through Bed Bath & Beyond and Linens 'n Things home stores. White Barn Candle has 130 dedicated specialty stores and is the candle house brand for the 1,600 stores of its corporate sister, Bath & Body Works. Partylite candles are exclusively distributed through 33,000 independent sales consultants who host parties and build excitement for the brand. Finally Blyth's Colonial Candle brand gives Yankee Candle a run for its money in the gift stores.

<p><strong>Purchase Drivers</strong></p>
Candles represent an indulgence item that gives consumers an emotional lift and only costs pocket change to buy—the perfect antidote for fending off the blues. As a consumer product, candles are unique. Burning a candle has a magical, transforming effect. One focus group respondent said: "Every woman looks beautiful in candlelight." Its flame mesmerizes, as this respondent describes: "I love to watch a candle burning. It's very relaxing to watch how they burn down." Its scent comforts and it sparks romance. Candles work on many different sensory levels to calm and refresh. A burning candle hearkens back to hearth and home. Candles are also a favorite gift item for holidays and throughout the year, as consumers seek gifts that will help them connect emotionally with loved ones and friends. One described the choice of candles as a perfect gift: "Everybody loves candles and you can get a really nice quality candle for $20 to $25, the price I like to spend on gifts."

<p>Lighting a candle often signals a break from the ordinary and a time to relax. For some people, it is almost a ritual. A respondent explains that every time she sits down in her home office to work, she lights a candle: "I love candles and I always burn candles especially when I am working. When I light my candle on my desk, it means I am ready to work." Candles also support bathing and cleaning rituals, with a candlelit bath representing the ultimate in luxury. The fresh scent that candles impart in the home conveys cleanliness: "It reflects on your home, if it smells good. A burning candle gives a scent that tells how you keep your home and make it more enjoyable." For consumers, the role of scent in burning candles is very important, as three-fourths of all candles consumed are scented.
</p>

<p>Yet there is a dark side to candles and that comes from the combustion of petroleum-based waxes. Indoor air pollution is becoming a concern, and while candles have a healthful glow, they can be a major source of indoor air pollutants, smoke, and dirt. I learned firsthand about the negative effects of over exuberant candle burning. Last year we had to repaint our living room as the soot from candles left tell-tale stains on the ceiling and walls. At our home now, candles are only an occasional indulgence.

<p><strong>Demographic Variables</strong><p>
Women are more likely to report candle purchases for their home, with 70 percent saying they or someone in their household bought a candle in the past year. However, with 53 percent of men reporting the same, this is hardly a female-only category. Despite their lower overall reported purchase, men represent a market for candles as they both purchase and influence the purchase of candles, especially when romance is on the agenda.

<p>Candle purchase is higher among the more youthful consumers, aged 44 and younger. Purchase incidence declines with age with the lowest overall purchase incidence among those 65 years and above. Candles also appeal to all ethnic groups, with blacks and Hispanics buying candles at a slightly higher incidence than white households.
</p>

<p>As household income rises, so does candle purchase incidence. The biggest jump in purchase incidence is found among the $35,000-to-$49,999 income range with 70 percent of these households reporting purchase. This elevated purchase incidence continues with rising income. Larger households buy more candles, with two-or-more-person households and those with children buying more candles than people living alone.
</p>
<p>Key Demographics of Buyers of Candles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a female-dominated category, with strong male participation.</li>
<li>There is a youthful skew in purchase incidence that falls after age 45.</li>
