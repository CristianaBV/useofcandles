<h1>Candles throughout history </h1>
Candle making was developed independently <strong>in many places throughout history</strong>.

Candles were made by the <i>Romans</i> beginning about <time year="500 before Christ">500 BC.</time> These were true dipped candles and made from tallow. Evidence for candles 
made from whale fat in <i>China</i> dates back to the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). In India, wax from boiling cinnamon was used for temple 
candles. In parts of <i>Europe</i>, the <i>Middle-East</i> and <i>Africa</i>, where lamp oil made from olives was readily available, candle making remained
unknown until the early middle-ages. Candles were primarily made from tallow and beeswax in ancient times, but have been made from 
spermaceti, purified animal fats (stearin) and paraffin wax in recent centuries.

<h3><p>Antiquity</p></h3>
The early <i>Greeks</i> used candles to honour the goddess Artemis's birth on the sixth day of every lunar month. Romans began making true 
dipped candles from allow, beginning around <abbr aria-label="before Christ">500 BC.</abbr> While oil lamps were the most widely used source of illumination in Roman Italy, 
candles were common and regularly given as gifts during Saturnalia. The mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang <abbr aria-label="before Christ">259–210 BC</abbr>, contained candles 
made from whale fat. The word zhú was used as candle during the Warring States period <abbr aria-label="before Christ">403–221 BC</abbr>; some excavated bronzewares from 
that era feature a pricket thought to hold a candle. The Han Dynasty 202 <abbr aria-label="Before Christ">BC</abbr> to 220<abbr aria-label="Anno Domini">AD</abbr> Jizhupian dictionary of about 40 BC hints at 
candles being made of beeswax, while the Book of Jin compiled in 648 covering the Jin Dynasty <time year="265–420">265-420</time> makes a solid reference to
the beeswax candle in regards to its use by the statesman Zhou Yi. An excavated earthenware bowl from the 4th century AD, 
located at the Luoyang Museum, has a hollowed socket where traces of wax were found. Generally these Chinese candles were molded in 
paper tubes, using rolled rice paper for the wick, and wax from an indigenous insect that was combined with seeds.Wax from boiling 
cinnamon was used for temple candles in <i>India</i>. Yak butterwas used for candles in Tibet There is a fish called the eulachon or 
"candlefish", a type of smelt which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the 1st century AD, indigenous people from this region 
used oil from this fish for illumination. A simple candle could be made by putting the dried fishon a forked stick and then lighting it.

<h3><p>Middle Ages</p></h3> 
After the collapse of the Roman empire, trading disruptions made olive oil, the most common fuel for oil lamps, unavailable 
throughout much of Europe. As a consequence, candles became more widely used. By contrast, in North Africa and the Middle East, 
candle-making remained relatively unknown due to the availability of olive oil.
Candles were commonplace throughout Europe in the Middle Ages. Candle makers (known as chandlers) made candles from fats saved 
from the kitchen or sold their own candles from within their shops. The trade of the chandler is also recorded by the more 
picturesque name of "smeremongere", since they oversaw the manufacture of sauces, vinegar, soap and cheese. The popularity of 
candles is shown by their use in Candlemas and in Saint Lucy festivities.
<p>Tallow, fat from cows or sheep, became the standard material used in candles in Europe. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is 
due to the glycerine they contain. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in 
several European cities. Beeswax was discovered to be an excellent substance for candle production without the unpleasant odour, 
but remained restricted in usage for the rich and for churches and royal events, due to their great expense.
In England and France, candle making had become a guild craft by the 13th century. The Tallow Chandlers Company of London was 
formed in about 1300 in London, and in 1456 was granted a coat of arms. The Wax Chandlers Company existed prior to 1330 and 
acquired its charter in 1484. By 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The first candle mould comes from the 15th 
century in Paris.</p>

<h3><p>The Modern Era</p></h3>
By the 19th century, candles were made on an industrial scale. This was to meet the demands of a growing population and better 
living conditions for the masses. The industrial-scale manufacture of candles was made possible thanks to the work of <b class="person">Joseph Morgan</b>.
A Manchester-based pewterer who patented a machine which allowed for the continuous production of moulded candles. Morgan’s machine
could produce up to 1,500 candles per hour. This also saw the introduction of braided, rather than twisted, wicks. Which helped to produce better performing,
self-trimming candles.
